With so many parameters, it's difficult to get enough data to prevent a NN from overfitting. And also, the computational requirements and the memory requirements to train a NN is a bit infeasible. Thus, for computer vison to use large images, we need to implement the convolution operation.\n",

It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges(at the lower level) to very complex features(at the deeper layers). However, using a deeper network doen't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent unbearly slow.More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero(or, in rare cases,grow exponentially quickly and explode to take very large values).\n",
    "- This problem can be solved by using a ResNet.In ResNets, a \"shortcut\" or a \"skip connection\" allow the gradient to be directly backpropogated to earlier layers. \n",
    "- Very, very deep NNs are difficult to train because of vanishing and exploding gradients problems. \n",
    "- In ResNets, we skip connection which makes you take the activation from one layer and suddently feed it to another layer even much deeper in NN which allows you to train deeper NNs even with layers greater than 100. \n",
    "- Theoratically, deeper and deeper NN should lead to smaller and smaller training error, but in practice, because of the vanishing and exploding gradients problems that performance of the network suffers as it goes deeper. While ResNets allows for deeper NN while not hurting the performance. \n",
    "- Two main types of locks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are same or different.\n",

    "    - The convolutional block: applies to the case where the input and output dimensions don't match up. The different with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path.  The CONV2D layer is used to resize the input x to a different dimension, so  that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add teh shortcut value back to the main path. \n",

Also, if all these residual blocks actually learned something useful then maybe you do even better. \n",
    "- Also, what goes wrong in very  deep palin nets without these residual blocks is that when you make the network deeper and deeper, it's actually very difficutlt for it to choose parameters that learn even the identity function which is why a lot of layers end up making your result worse. \n",
    "- The main reason that residul network works is that it's so easy for these extra layers to learn the identity function that you're kind of guaranteed that it doesn't hurt performance and then a lot of the time you maybe be lucky and then even helps performance."

    "        - Discard any remaining box with $IOU>0.5$ with that box output in the previous step. \n",
    "    - Repeatly doing the previous step until you've taken each of the boxes and either output it as a prediction, or discard it as having too high IOU.\n",

    "## Anchor boxes\n",
    "- One of the problems with object detection as we have seen so far is that each of the grid cells can detect only one object, what if a grid cell wants to detect multiple objects?  \n",
    "- For example, a person standing in front of a car, the center of the car and the person are almost the same position and both of them fall into the same grid cell, the algorithm we saw before will not give two detections.  \n",
    "- To solve this problem,We can use the idea of anchor boxes. \n",
    "- With the idea of anchor boxes, we are going to choose multiple different pre-defined shpaes, and associate multiple predictions with the multiple anchor boxes.  \n",
    "- Previously, each object in training image is assigned to grid cell that contains that object's midpoint. With anchor boxes, each object in training image is assigned to grid cell (that contains object's midpoint) and anchor box with highest IOU. \n",
    "- For example, if we have two anchor box, the target label with be $P_c,P_x,p_y,p_w,p_h, c1,c2,c3 $ associated with anchor box 1, and then another set of output associated withe anchor box 2. \n",
    "- anchor box essentialy refer to a set of values$P_c,P_x,p_y,p_w,p_h, c1,c2,c3 $,  your output will have a dimension which is  8 * number of anchor boxes\n",
    "- You may use k-mean clustering to choose anchor boxes."

    "### Face recognization\n",
    "- Face verification vs. face recognization\n",
    "    - Verification \"Is this the claimed person\"\n",
    "        - Input: Image and name/ID\n",
    "        - Output: whether the input image is that of the claimed person\n",
    "    - Recogization \"Who is this person\"\n",
    "        - Has a database of K persons\n",
    "        - Get an input image\n",
    "        - Output ID if the image is any of the K persons\n",
    "- We can use a face verification system as block to build a face recognization system.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  One shot learning\n",
    "- One of the face recognition challenges is to solve one shot learning problem, which means to recognize a person using one image.\n",
    "- Historically, deep learning doesn't work well with a small number of data\n",
    "- Instead, we will learn a similarity function:\n",
    "    - d(img1, img2) = degree of difference between images\n",
    "    - We want d to be low in case of the same faces\n",
    "    - We use tau T as a threshold for d: \n",
    "        - If d(img1, img2) < = T then the faces are the same\n",
    "- Similarity function helps us solving the one shot learning, also its robust to new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Siamese Network\n",
    "- The simililarity function can be implemented using a type of CNN called Siamese Network.\n",
    "- Siamese Network output an feature vector as an encoding of  the input image.\n",
    "- ``` d(img1, img2) = || feature_vector(img1) - feature_vector(img2)||^2```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triplet Loss\n",
    "-  Is one of the loss function we can use to learn the parameters in Siamese Network\n",
    "- Our learning objective in the triplet loss function to  get the distance between and an Anchor image and a positive or a negative image.\n",
    "    - Positive means the same person, while negative means different person\n",
    "- Formally, we want\n",
    "    - Positive distance to be less than the negative distance\n",
    "    - To make sure that the NN won't get an output  zero/ set the encodings equal to each other, we let\n",
    "        ```|| f(A) - f(p)||^2 - ||f(A) - f(N)|| ^2 + alpha < = 0```\n",
    "- Final loss funcion:\n",
    "    - L(A,P,N) = max(|| f(A) - f(p)||^2 - ||f(A) - f(N)|| ^2 + alpha, 0): So long as you achived your goal , which is the first term is < 0, the lost is 0.\n",
    "    - J = sum(L(A(i),P(i),N(i))) for all triplets of images\n",

    "### Neural Style Transfer\n",
    "- To visualize what a deep learning layer is learning, pick a unit in layer l. Find the nine image patches that maximize the unit's activation. \n",
    "- It turns out the shallow layers are learning low level features like edge or colors, while deeper layers are learning more complex feature. \n",
    "#### Cost function\n",

    "    - J(G) = alpha * J(C,G) + beta J(S,G)\n",
    "    - $\\alpha, \\beta$ are relative weighting to the similarity and these are hyperparameters.\n",
    "    - In practice,only one hyperparameter is needed.\n",

    "    - Initiate G randomly:\n",
    "    - Use a gradient descent to minimize J(G), G = G - dG\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Content cost function\n",
    "- Say you use hidden layer l to computer content test:\n",
    "    - If we choose l to be really small, then it will really force your generated image to pixel values very similar to your cotent image. \n",
    "    - In practice l is not too small and not too deep but in the middle. \n",
    "- Use pre-trained ConvNet(E.g. VGG network)\n",
    "- Let a(C)[l] and a(G)[l] be the activation of layer l on the images\n",
    "- If a(C)[l] and a(G)[l] are similar then they will have the same content.\n",
    "    - J(C,G) at layer l = 1/2|| a(C)[l] - a(G)(l)||^2\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Style Cost function\n",
    "- Say you are using layer l's activation to measure Style\n",
    "- Define style as correlation between activations across channels. \n",
    "- Correlation tells you which of these high level features/ texture compoenents detected by different channels  tend to occur or not to occure gogether.\n",
    "- More formally, given an image, calculate the Style matrix\n",
    "  - Let a(i,j,k)[l] = activation at (i,j,k). \n",
    "  - The style matrix G[l] has dimension n^{[l]}{_c} x n^{[l]}{_c} $. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - ```G_{kk'}^{[l]} = \\sum _ {i=1}^{n_H^{[l]}} a_{ijk}^{[l]}a_{ijk'}^{[l]}```\n",
    "- More specifically, $G^{[l]}_{kk'}$ measure how correlated are the activations in channel k compared to the activations in channel $k'$ \n",
    "- G_{kk'} is big, means more correlation\n",
    "- It turns out that you get more visual pleasing results if you use the sytle cost function from multiple layers. So the overall style cost function \n",
